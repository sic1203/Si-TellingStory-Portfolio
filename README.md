Hello everyone!
My name is Si Chen and I am a 2nd year master in public policy and management. Just one year ago, I earned my bachelorâ€™s in Public Utilities Administration from North China Electric Power University in China. I spent almost half a year to investigate Chinese current family situation in many cities, and also used my 1-year school time to take an internship as a policy investigator for Chinese left-behind children, which refers to children who remain in rural regions of China while their parents leave to work in urban areas. During each summer of my college, I went to Sri Lanka to work as an international volunteer. Over the summer, I worked for the City of Pittsburgh as a change management internship.
I travel a lot and have lots of interests. My biggest hobby is diving and I just finished my glacier diving in Iceland this winter. Beyond diving, I love hiking, rock music, and movies. I went to Boston last May for a three-day music festival and enjoyed two concerts in Pittsburgh during last summer vacation, Radiohead and Arctic Monkeys! 

#***What I hope to learn***
  * I want to learn more about color theory and popular design choice to improve my data visualization.
  * I want to get to know some ways to providing a Human-centerred design for my future digital design or digital products.
  * I want to learn how to improve my data visualization and apply properly ways for explaining or presenting my story to audience.
